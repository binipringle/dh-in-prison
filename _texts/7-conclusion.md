As the global coronavirus pandemic kills hundreds of thousands of people around the world and causes millions more to suffer severe economic hardship, disruption and damage to their health and safety, we are in a changed world. Digital technologies play a huge part in worker safety and employability as companies and public agencies move more and more of their operations online.  Many academic, social, civic and devotional communities have largely moved online. Now more than ever it is imperative that incarcerated people acquire the skills they need to reintegrate into an increasingly technological world. As waves of this pandemic return and continue to physically isolate us from each other, digital literacy is a basic requirement to go back to school, work and hold fragile communities together. If people recently released from prison succeed in their reentry into society, we all succeed in making our communities better, more humane and safer places to live. Teaching digital skills in the context of digital humanities provides us with the opportunity to question and critically assess our relationships with and within the technology-driven infrastructures that govern or affect almost every aspect of society at the present time. By gaining a bit more understanding of what computers do and what we can do with them, we gain a lot more agency, ownership and control over our lives, which in turn allows us to continue our journey forwards in the pursuit of a happier, more just and more equitable world.
