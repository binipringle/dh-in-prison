As the Covid-19 pandemic kills hundreds of thousands of people around the world, devastating prisons, jails, detention centers, factories, nursing homes, and all the other places where we as a society fail to keep them safe, we find ourselves in a changed world. Digital technologies play a huge part in worker safety and employability.  Many academic, social, civic and devotional communities are moving or may move online. Now more than ever it is imperative that incarcerated people acquire the skills they need to reintegrate into an increasingly technological world. As waves of this pandemic return and continue to physically distance us - those of us who can be distanced - from each other, digital literacy is a basic requirement to go back to school, work and hold fragile communities together.

If people recently released from prison succeed in their reentry into society, we all succeed in making our communities better, more humane and safer places to live. Teaching digital skills in the context of digital humanities provides the opportunity to question and critically assess our relationships with and within the technology-driven infrastructures that govern or affect almost every aspect of society at the present time. By gaining a bit more understanding of what computers do and what we can do with them, we gain a lot more agency, ownership and control over our lives, which in turn helps us continue to fight for a happier, more just and more equitable world.
