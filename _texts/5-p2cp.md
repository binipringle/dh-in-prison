# Why Otisville

The Prison-to-College Pipeline (P2CP) program is CUNY’s college-in-prison program. It is run by the Institute for Justice and Opportunity[^1] at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at Otisville Correctional Facility in upstate New York.  P2CP allows incarcerated students to enroll in and take college courses and guarantees all passing students a spot in a CUNY college upon release. It is a robust, proven program that has been in place since 2011, and since its beginning has made possible many instances of student success. The P2CP program aims to further CUNY’s mission of providing higher education to everyone who is eligible to go to college. This, notes P2CP Founding Director Baz Draesinger, “includes the prison population on a very basic level, [many of whom] did not have access to higher education to begin with or quality education before that.” In a sense, she said, “we’re enacting our duty as a society to offer people the education that they should have gotten in the first place” (“The Prison-to-College Pipeline”). These goals align perfectly with the goal of this project, namely, to expand the field of digital humanities to include incarcerated people among its practitioners because they have a just as much of a right as we do to participate in the exciting scholarship being performed in this field. Thus, by integrating DH in Prison in P2CP, students will benefit, the field of DH will grow and benefit, and the mission of CUNY will be further advanced.

[^1]: Founded in 2005, the Prisoner Reentry Institute was officially renamed the Institute for Justice and Opportunity in April 2020.

P2CP is funded by the Institute for Justice and Opportunity, and some tuition costs are covered by Obama’s First Step Act. CUNY professors travel to Otisville, which is 75 miles from the city, to teach accredited, credit-bearing college courses in English, sociology, anthropology, mathematics, and other liberal arts disciplines. There are also guest speakers, academic counseling, skills development workshops and the Learning Exchange, a credit-bearing course facilitated by a CUNY faculty member to expose students to academic topics beyond the standard course offerings and gives students at Otisville an opportunity to network with their peers from John Jay. Because P2CP is part of CUNY, students who want to go on to fields of study that incorporate digital humanities within CUNY will receive support.[^2]

[^2]: Students might choose at some point to apply to the MA in Digital Humanities program at the Graduate Center; also, digital humanities are being taught in English Departments and other departments CUNY-wide, and more and more disciplines are incorporating digital skills in their course offerings.

# Logistics

## Hardware

An introduction to digital humanities course for fifteen students will require seventeen laptops. Fifteen of these will be individual student laptops, one will be the instructor’s laptop, and the other will act as the server. Individual laptops will either be wired to the server with a LAN switch or connected wirelessly to the server via a modem. The instructor will also have one external hard drive and/or USB stick for backup, course readings and additional resources. Two external CD/DVD drives will also be needed; one which will remain in the facility to read CD-ROMs the instructor may need to bring in, and the other, which will not be brought in to the facility, for the instructor to burn additional software, programs and course material files to CD-ROMs after the start of the semester as needed.

## Programs and software

The computer programs and learning resources for the Introduction to Digital Humanities course will be pre-installed on student laptops and/or the instructor’s laptop. Students will submit assignments, share their work with each other and collaborate on projects through Ubuntu’s Public Folder, which will be accessed through the local network. Students will also be able to use some of the built-in applications that come with Ubuntu, including the Libre Office suite and the three games (solitaire, mines and sudoku).

## Course delivery

A lot of the course will be delivered digitally in class on the course laptops. Readings can be both digital and printed. The printed reading matter can be assigned as homework. A lot of coding logic can also be assigned as homework and done with pen and paper, then tried out in class. Students should probably each be assigned a laptop at the beginning of the semester and continue to use the same laptop throughout the semester, as this will allow them to save things they are working on individually and give them ownership over their work and accountability for what they do with the laptop. The course would have to be taught by CUNY faculty, which could be a graduate student, adjunct or full-time faculty. They would probably have to be hired by John Jay to teach the course, although maybe a first pilot course could be taught or partly taught by Graduate Center PhD students in some kind of collaboration with the Digital Humanities Program at CUNY Graduate Center.  The GC Digital Fellows, who created the technical skills tutorial sessions we have adapted for the course website, could be invited to offer the workshops on technical skills. Maybe the New Media Lab could participate.

Because learning digital skills usually involves a lot of practice, it would be great if students were allowed to use their laptops in tutoring sessions. Tutors could be provided through the Petey Greene Program, which already works with the Prisoner Reentry Institute to provide tutors for pre-college programs in New York City jails and could bring tutors from SUNY New Paltz, which is only 30 miles from Otisville.

## Security

All hardware will remain on the facility. If the instructor needs to bring additional material such as computer programs, software or files to the facility, it is probably best that the instructor bring these on a read-only CD-ROM than a USB because in New York State prisons all removable storage devices are contraband (Directive 4911, Attachment A).  

# Budget

Minimal computing prompts us to find computing solutions only for what is really needed, at the lowest possible cost. The hardware we list here is what we consider strictly necessary for the delivery of the course as we keep in mind not only monetary cost but also cost in labor and cost in student effort as well as hidden costs incurred by dependence on systems with costs of their own. We understand that there may be a computer lab at Otisville Correctional Facility. We considered delivering the course without the laptops if a facility already had computers of their own. However, we found that relying on computers with operating systems and a variety of programs already installed would make it a lot more difficult to deliver the course. We concluded that what we gain in working in Ubuntu, a free open source operating system widely used by software developers, justifies the cost of buying seventeen laptops.  If we were to use computers already at a facility, these would probably be Windows PCs or possibly Macs, so by using them we would incur the hidden costs of their systems as well as the cost in labor of installing the programs and software we need. There would also be the cost in labor of troubleshooting all the issues that would almost certainly arise during installation and those which would almost certainly come up in class.

The following budget is for the hardware only. We have not included cost of travel to and from Otisville or instructor stipend. The following prices are estimates:

item	| price per item | quantity needed	| cost  
Laptop	| $350 |	17 |	$5,950
24-port LAN switch and cables or wireless router |	$200 |	1	| $200
External CD/DVD drive	| $45	| 2	 | $90
Box of blank CDs |	$10	| 1	| $10
Unforeseen expenses	| $100 |	1	| $100
		| |TOTAL |	$6,350

# Sample lesson plan

Once students have learned to use the command line, version control, some html and css, and built a simple website with Jekyll, they will be ready to learn some Python. One of the activities we did in the Graduate Center Digital Research institute which I loved was xxxx’s Haunted House game. She used Python to code a game which is played on the computer terminal, where the player answers a series of questions and gets binary answers that take them to one situation or another, with new questions prompting them on. The great thing about this game is that when you look at it you really get a sense of how imagined spaces can be coded and shared, and how the sprawling branches of the game open up possibilities that can be coded on and on, opening up a virtual labyrinth that students can work on together and play. The more complex it becomes the wider the finite array of situations grows. (note to Matt: this bit is unfinished)
