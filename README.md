## About

<a href="https://binipringle.github.io/dh-in-prison/">DH in Prison</a> is a capstone and thesis in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Digital Humanities, The City University of New York. My <a href="https://binipringle.github.io/dh-in-prison/">thesis</a> discusses the need for including digital humanities courses in college-in-prison programs, and outlines how minimal computing methods can be used to offer incarcerated students an introductory digital humanities course and teach them the necessary technical skills. My capstone, <a href="https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/">Intro to DH</a>, is a proof of concept for the course itself.
