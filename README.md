# DH in Prison
## a minimal computing project for teaching digital humanities theory, skills and methods to incarcerated people

## About

"Introduction to Digital Humanities" is a one semester 3-credit course that aims to introduce students to the landscape of digital humanities tools and methods through readings and classroom and online discussions, hands-on workshops, and collaborative projects. Students will explore a broad range of ways to critically evaluate and incorporate digital technologies into their academic research. In addition, they will explore both the general field and a particular area of interest to them, produce a series of digital projects individually and in collaboration with fellow students, and learn how to present their digital work effectively.

As a minimal computing project this course is designed to run on a fairly simple computer network with no internet connection. Students will learn digital skills as well as tools and methods for exploring humanities subjects and doing humanistic research under significant constraints particular to prisons. Students will learn version control (git), HTML and CSS, Python, and Jekyll (Ruby). These technical skills can be foundational for gaining expertise in software design, mapping, data visualization, games, artificial intelligence, text mining, UX design and other specializations in subsequent semesters.

A lot of the course materials and resources are on this static website. Other resources such as digital editions of texts, datasets and images can be brought in by the instructor if you request them for a project. All requests have to be screened and approved by the prison education office so it is a good idea to request them as soon as you know what you might need.

This site was built with Ed., a Jekyll theme. To clone DH in Prison, follow the installation steps described in Ed.:
