<p>

  DH in Prison is a capstone and thesis in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Digital Humanities, The City University of New York. My thesis (on this site) discusses the need for including digital humanities courses in college-in-prison programs, and outlines how minimal computing methods can be used to offer incarcerated students an introductory digital humanities course and teach them the necessary technical skills. My capstone, <a href="https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/">Intro to DH</a>, is a proof of concept for the course itself.
